About: 
This project is about sorting numbers but instead of having the most efficient or quick way of sorting they want us to do it in the least amount of order possible.

Usage:
Clone and make. 
Execute with "./push_swap list_or_numbers_to_order" and it will display the orders(the valid ones acording to the subject) it does to make the numbers in order.
