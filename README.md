## About: 
This project is about sorting numbers but instead of having the most efficient or quick way of sorting they want us to do it in the least amount of order possible.

## Usage:
Make will create the executable. 
Execute with "./push_swap <list_or_numbers_to_order>" and it will display the orders it does to make the numbers in order. A valid list can't have duplicates.
The program will use 2 list and swap or rotare them in order to sort the number in the least amout of orders possible.
